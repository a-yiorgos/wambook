Warren's Abstract Machine: A Tutorial Reconstruction by Hassan Ait-Kaci

Warren's Abstract Machine: A Tutorial Reconstruction is a book written by
Hassan Ait-Kaci. The book explains the Warren Abstract Machine and is now out
of print. The author owns the copyright and for a time the book was available
at: http://vanx.org/archive/wam/wam.html for free to anyone who wanted to use
it for non-commercial purposes.

vanx.org seems to be a parcked domain at the moment so I setup this page for anyone interested in the electronic version of the book.
